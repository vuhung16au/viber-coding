# human readable links

make human readable links with router next js 

for example 

link: http://localhost:3002/en/quiz/-OO_lXUI-J9ToaW0MfCN
with the quiz description (in unicode "tên tôi là"),

the human readable link should be: 

new link: http://localhost:3002/en/quiz/-OO_lXUI-J9ToaW0MfCN/ten-toi-la
old link: http://localhost:3002/en/quiz/-OO_lXUI-J9ToaW0MfCN
- make sure that the links are human readable and SEO friendly
- ensure that the generated slugs are unique for each quiz

Sample code:
```
import unidecode from 'unidecode';

function generateSlug(text) {
  const transliterated = unidecode(text); // Converts "tên tôi là" to "ten toi la"
  return transliterated
    .toLowerCase()          // "ten toi la"
    .replace(/\s+/g, '-')   // "ten-toi-la"
    .replace(/[^\w\-]+/g, ''); // Removes any remaining special characters
}

// Example usage
const description = "tên tôi là";
const slug = generateSlug(description); // Outputs: "ten-toi-la"
```
