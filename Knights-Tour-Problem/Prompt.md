# Convert Python to Notebook 

Convert #file:knights-tour-problem.py into a Jupyter notebook and save that file under this folder.

In the notebook, instead of display the animation, save the animation to a gif file named knights-tour-solutions.gif and knights-tour-solutions.mp4.

Additionally, ensure to include necessary libraries such as matplotlib and imageio for saving the animations.
