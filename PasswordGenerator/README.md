# Advanced Password Generator

A powerful, customizable password generator tool that runs entirely in your browser.

## What is this program

This Advanced Password Generator is a web-based tool designed to create secure, random passwords based on customizable criteria. It offers extensive options for password generation, including:

- Variable password length (8-30 characters)
- Inclusion of numbers, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and symbols
- Option to begin passwords with a letter
- Ability to avoid similar-looking characters (e.g., i, I, 1, L, o, O, 0)
- Prevention of duplicate or sequential characters
- Batch generation of multiple passwords at once

The generator emphasizes security and privacy by operating completely on the client-side, with no data transmission over the internet.

## How to run it

1. **Online Usage**:
   - Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser
   - No installation or server setup required

2. **Offline Usage**:
   - Download all three files: `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`
   - Save them in the same directory on your computer
   - Open the `index.html` file in your browser whenever you need to generate passwords

## Tech Stack
