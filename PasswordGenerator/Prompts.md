# Main prompt

I want to create a password generator that runs in the browser. The generator should have the following options/features:

```
Password Length: default: 16. Min: 6, Max: 30
Include Numbers: Yes/No (e.g. 123456)
Include Lowercase Characters: Yes/No (e.g. abcdefgh)
Include Uppercase Characters: Yes/No ( e.g. ABCDEFGH )
Begin With A Letter: Yes/No (don't begin with a number or symbol)
Include Symbols: Yes/No. List of symbols: !";#$%&*()+.-/::;<=>?@[]^_`{}~
No Similar Characters: Yes/No (don't use characters like i, I, 1, L, o, O, 0, etc.)
No Duplicate Characters: Yes/No (don't use the same character more than once)
No Sequential Characters: Yes/No (don't use sequential characters, e.g. abc, 789)
Auto Generate On The First Call: (generate passwords automatically when you open this page)
Save My Preference: Yes/No (save all the settings above in cookies)
```
